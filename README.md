# N-Body Simulation

This is a fun side project building simulations in C. I'm currently building an N-body simulation, but want to branch into others as well.

## Building and Running

Project is being developed on Linux, I'm not sure if it'd work on other OS.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install OpenGL and GLUT.
3. Run `make` to build the project.
4. Run `make run` to run the simulation.
